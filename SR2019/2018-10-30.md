Hi Everyone!

This weekend is the last weekend before our kick-off event (Kickstart) and we've got a lot of kits left to pack!

If you're able to make it to the University of Southampton this weekend it would be great if you could help with kit packing and event preparation!

[Click here to help!][volunteer-form]

We'll be working in room 4025 (top floor lecture theatre) of [Building 53][building-53].

There's a small chance it might be in a different building, make sure you've clicked the button above to get an email with the updated location.

Also the building is ID card access only, so you'll likely need to be let in, so make sure you've [signed up to the slack][slack-signup] so you can ask to be let in when you arrive.
