Hi,

This coming Saturday, the 4th May, we'll be having a kit collation event to go
through this years team kits, clean up and test the parts and collate them into
boxes by part. This is similar to the activity weekends before this year's
Kickstart, without the packaging of the parts into team kit boxes.

We're still confirming our room booking at the University of Southampton but
we're expecting to be in the Mountbatten building.

Thanks,
Peter
