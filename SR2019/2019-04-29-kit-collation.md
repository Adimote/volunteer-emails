Hi,

This coming Saturday, the 4th May, we'll be having a kit collation event to go
through this years team kits, clean up and test the parts and collate them into
boxes by part. This is similar to the activity weekends before this year's
Kickstart, without the packaging of the parts into team kit boxes.

We'll be meeting in the Mountbatten building at the University of Southampton.
We'll start around 11am and aim to finish about 6pm, though if you can only
spare a couple of hours you'd still be most welcome to come and help out.

When you get to the Mountbatten building, please message `@here` in the
[`#events`][events-channel] in Slack and someone will let you in.

Thanks,
Peter
