Hey Everyone!

We announced the competition a few weeks back, and it's getting close to the Kick-off event: 'Kickstart' on the 10th of November, which will simultaneously be at the [offices for 'Thread'](https://goo.gl/UzDEPv) in London and at the University of Southampton.

Sign up here: https://goo.gl/forms/25Bf6VCReLXR3zUf1

We've got a few tasks to sort out pre-kickstart, so if you're interested in joining in on the community of people actively sorting the events, feel free to email me and I'll find something for you to do. Or go to https://github.com/srobo/tasks and find a task that suits you (obviously check with us on slack before starting on the task, to make sure nobody else works on it too).
