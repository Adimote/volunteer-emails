Hey Everyone!

We announced the competition a few weeks back, and it's getting close to the Kick-off event: 'Kickstart' on the 10th of November, which will simultaneously be at the [offices for 'Thread'][thread-map] in London and at the University of Southampton. See our event pages for [London][london-event] and [Southampton][soton-event] for more info.

Sign up to volunteer to kickstart on this form: https://goo.gl/forms/25Bf6VCReLXR3zUf1

We've got a few tasks to sort out pre-kickstart, so if you're interested in joining in on the community of people actively sorting the events, feel free to [join our slack][slack-signup] and ask there, or have a look at [our list of tasks that need doing before kickstart][kickstart-tasks] and find a task that suits you (obviously check with us on slack before starting on the task, to make sure nobody else works on it too).
