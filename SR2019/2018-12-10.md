Hi Everyone!

## Tech Days

We've scheduled some tech days in Southampton, which will also be the dates for potential tech days in London. (The London tech days will only happen if enough teams express interest).

Tech days are days when we as volunteers make ourselves available to teams to help them out with their robots.
It's usually a great time for teams to make some progress, and for us to see how the robots are progressing.

The planned dates are:

- 15th December
- 9th February
- 9th March

If you have the time to help out, fill out this form to say you can come:

You can edit the form afterwards, so if you're not sure about a date, feel free to leave that date checked until you know (That way you'll get the reminder emails). The first tech day is this Saturday, so we really need you to say whether you can come by then.


## Mentoring

Also, if you want to help out more, we'll be starting mentoring in the new year, which are regular sessions where we go to teams where they are to assist them with their robot building.

We desperately need more mentors so if you have the time you can sign up here:
