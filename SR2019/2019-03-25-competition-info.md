Hi,

Thank you for volunteering to help at this year's Student Robotics competition!

The competition is fast approaching, so we thought it best to give you an update with everything you need to know.

The competition is going to be held at Southampton University's Student Union building (SUSU) over the weekend of the 6th-7th of April, though setup will on Thursday 21th and teardown will finish on Monday 8th. When you signed up we asked for your availability over these dates if this has changed please let us know as soon as possible.

If you requested accommodation on the signup form and have not heard from us about your arrangments, please let us know.

Parking locations at the university can be found on [the website](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2019/competition/#parking). Unfortunately, on the setup and teardown days, free parking cannot be guaranteed, though it will be available over the Saturday and Sunday.

When you arrive head straight to SUSU (marked on the [parking map](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2019/competition/#parking) with the Student Robotics logo) and try to find Andy Barret-Sprot to be given your schedule. Depending on when you arrive Andy may not be in SUSU, if this is the case phone the competition phone on 07424603539.

Thanks again for volunteering to help, without you and the rest of our amazing volunteers we would not be able to run the competition. If you happen to know anyone who may be interested in helping at future competitions be sure to point them at our [volunteer sign up page](https://studentrobotics.org/volunteer).

See you at the competition!
