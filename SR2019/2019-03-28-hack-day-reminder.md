Hi,

As the competition is in 9 days, we've got some final things which need sorting, so we're doing one last volunteer hack-day this weekend to make sure we're prepared for the competition!

Please come and help if you can! The more help we have now, the better the competition will be!

We'll be holding the hack day on Saturday and likely Sunday in the top floor seminar room of the [Mountbatten building](https://goo.gl/maps/roAbm76h8it) (Building 53) at the University of Southampton from about 10am to 5pm (feel free to arrive later or leave early). 

The building doors are locked on weekends, so please call Tyler on <phonenumber> to be let in. He may be arriving later on though, so be prepared to grab a coffee if you need letting in early in the day.
