Hi All,

We've just announced the competition location and date!

It'll be April 6th to 7th, at the University of Southampton Highfield campus (see the bottom of the email on why we're going back to this venue). We'll be sending a volunteer sign-up form around soon!

## Next Tech Day: February 9th

Our [next Tech Day][february-tech-day] is happening on February 9th, in 2 locations: the University of Southampton, and the offices for Thread in London.

If you're interested in helping out at the Tech Day, update/fill out your response to the [tech day sign-up form][tech-day-form].

There's [one more tech day][march-tech-day] scheduled after this, on March 9th.

## Why are we using Uni of Southampton for the competition?

Sadly the number of teams responding to our call for teams dropped from 52 to 37, this is perfectly understandable, as we were out of action for a year. This number of teams has allowed us to go to a smaller (and much cheaper) venue. Hopefully we see a much higher growth next year, so we can get back to 52 teams or higher!
