Hi All,

We've just announced the competition location and date!

It'll be April 6th to 7th, at the University of Southampton Highfield campus (see the bottom of the email on why we're going back to this venue). We'll be sending a volunteer sign-up form around soon!

## Next Tech Day: February 9th

Our next Tech Day is happening on February 9th, at the University of Southampton, and likely also in the offices for Thread, in London.

If you're interested in helping out at the tech day, update/fill out your response to the [tech day sign-up form][tech-day-form]

## Why have we gone back to the older venue?

Sadly the number of teams responding to our call for teams  dropped from 52 to 37, this is perfectly understandable, as we were out of action for a year. Hopefully we see a much higher growth next year, so we can get back to 52 teams or higher!
