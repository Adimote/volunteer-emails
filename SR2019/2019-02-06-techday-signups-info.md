Hi,

You're getting this email because you indicated you were available to attend the tech day on the 9th of February.

We're hosting it in both Southampton and London. This time I recommend you go to London if you indicated you're available for both, as we're going to need a few more volunteers there.

## Southampton Tech Day

If you're available to visit the Southampton tech day, the details are available at https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2019/southampton-tech-day-february/

Here's some extra info specific for volunteers:

If convenient, arrive at 9am for set-up. If you're making it for set-up, meet at the [Mountbatten Building][mountbatten], top floor seminar room. To be let into the building, call <Anton's number>.

We're about to announce a venue change (to a different building on the same campus), so please check the on-campus directions PDF in the evening to get the new location.

It would be great to email Andy to mention you're coming:

## London Tech Day

Most details are available at https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2019/london-tech-day-february/ however here is the information specific to volunteers:

If convenient, try to arrive at 9:30am-ish for set up. If you need access, or have any questions, Peter will be vigilantly monitoring his email, <peters email> so he should promptly reply.

It would be great to email Peter to mention you're coming:
