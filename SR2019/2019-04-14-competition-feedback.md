Hi,

A huge thank you for helping out at this year's competition, we wouldn't be able
to make it happen without your efforts. In order to help us improve for the
future, we'd really appreciate it if you could spend a few minutes providing
some feedback on you feel the event went and what we can do to improve.

In order to do that, we've prepared a couple of Google forms:
- https://forms.gle/EgqwMHZX9FgGifUG8 for general feedback, and
- https://forms.gle/ZPF1gCauLVQCzhT77 for role-specific feedback

We'd really appreciate if you could use these to tell us about your experiences
at the competition, whether you felt it all went well or there are things you
think we need to improve.

We'll use your feedback as the basis for discussions within the Core Team and
wider community on what and how we can improve for the future.
