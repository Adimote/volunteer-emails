Hi,

A huge thank you for helping out at this year's competition, we wouldn't be able
to make it happen without your efforts. In order to help us improve for the
future, we'd really appreciate it if you could spend a few minutes providing
some feedback on you feel the event went and what we can do to improve.

In order to do that, we've prepared some feedback forms:

We'd really appreciate if you could use these to tell us about your experiences
at the competition, whether you felt it all went well or there are things you
think we need to improve.

Please fill out https://forms.gle/EgqwMHZX9FgGifUG8 to give us general feedback.

It would also be excellent if you could spend some time giving feedback on each of
the roles you performed during the competition:

<!-- personalised of roles with pre-filled links to forms, to be populated
before sending-->

Also if you'd like to fill out feedback for any other roles, please use this link:

We'll use your feedback as the basis for discussions within the Core Team and
wider community on what and how we can improve for the future.
