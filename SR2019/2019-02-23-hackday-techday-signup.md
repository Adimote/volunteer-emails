Hi,

The competition is getting nearer and there are many things to do, we have a list of [tasks][task-list] which will need doing before the competition.
If you have some spare time and can give us a hand your help would be much appreciated and will help us run an even better competition.
There are several ways you can get involved and help out.

* Come along to the preparation day in Southampton on the 2nd.
* Come along to the tech day on the 9th where we will also be doing preparation (signup [here][techday-signup]).
* Take on some tasks on the task list, make sure to post a reply on the task so we know you are working on it (don't worry if you don't know everything about a task just ask for any help you need).

If you haven't [signed up for the competition][signup-form] yet there is still time to do so, we will be sending out information regarding accommodation and transport in the next couple of weeks.
