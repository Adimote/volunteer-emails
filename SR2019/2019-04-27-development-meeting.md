Hi

Now that the competition is over, we have some time to look into future development of kit and competition software. 

There will be a meeting held, with SourceBots, as there is a large overlap between our kits.

There are two main deadlines that we will face: 
- August 2019: SourceBots / Smallpeice Summer School 
- October / November 2019: Student Robotics Kickstart

An agenda for the meeting has been written and has been [published online](https://hackmd.io/1zHBGaozQxyxJBvvoaeMVw). Please feel free to add any relevant points that you would like to discuss.

The meeting will be held on **Monday 29th April, 7 - 8pm**.
