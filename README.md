Log of emails to volunteers

## Sending an email to volunteers

1. Write your email in [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
2. Add metadata to your email. This should specify who the email is being sent to, and the subject. Take a look at previous emails for formatting guidance.
3. Fork this repo, and commit your email. The file should be named based on the _expected_ send date, in a directory corresponding to the competition cycle year.
4. Request the PR be reviewed. Either by using the 'Reviewers' functionality in GitHub, or by sending a message in [#volunteering](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/messages/volunteering).
5. Once the PR is approved, request it be sent. Currently this requires either [`@jhoward`](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/messages/jhoward) or [`@abarrett-sprot`](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/messages/abarrett-sprot) in Slack (improvements in progress).
