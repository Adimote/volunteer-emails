Hello,

Hope you have all been enjoying the summer and are now ready to start helping work towards Student Robotics 2020!

There are a few different ways for you to get involved:

## The Game

We are currently looking for game design ideas for this year's competition. To submit a game proposal, please email [insert appropriate email here] with a description up to about a page in length (feel free to add in diagrams if you'd like).

The submission deadline is the end of Sunday 1st September

### What we are looking for in a game

    - Played by 4 fully autonomous robots, but still playable by as few as 2
    - Be playable in an arena up to about 8m squared
    - Last for between 2-4 minutes
    - Have point scoring that is accessible for teams of a wide range of abilities 
    - Have an arena layout that is easily and quickly set up at the beginning of each round

### Capabilities of the robots

    - Robots are no more than 500x500x500mm at the start of the match (although may expand after the match starts)
    - Camera gives positional feedback of any fidutial markers in view

After this date all submissions will be reviewed and discussed during a meeting open to all volunteers before the game design in finalised.

We look forward to looking through all your game design submissions!

## The Kit

Kickstart is on the horizon and we need to prepare the kits, ensuring they're in good condition for this year's teams. We will be hosting a kit collation event or two at Southampton University in the coming weeks, and we would love to have as many of you as possible to help out.

If you'd like to develop our next-generation kit, you can join the Kit Team who are responsible for maintaining and upgrading our existing SR kit. [insert contact detail for kit team?]
