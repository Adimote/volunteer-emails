## Tech Days in 2020

Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their robot with lots of help available. Theyâ€™re also an opportunity to see how other teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

These will be in Thread's offices at 1 Alie Street in London, on the following
Saturdays next year:
