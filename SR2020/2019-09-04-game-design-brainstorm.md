subject: SR2020 Game Design Brainstorming Meeting
---

Hello!

As announced in a previous email, we're starting the process of designing the game. We've already had some great suggestions, and we need to refine these into what becomes a basis for the final game.

The aim in this meeting will be to form the game the robots will play, which may be one of the submissions or a combination of ideas. During the following week, the chosen idea will be honed via discussion in Slack before being formalised into rules.

The brainstorming meeting will happen on Saturday 7th @ 14:00. We're hoping the meeting won't take much longer than a few hours, but any time you can give is greatly appreciated - Feel free to come and go as you please! The meetings will be *very* informal, relaxed, and likely culminate in a social.

As well as being a Google Meet call, the meeting will also be happening in 2 locations:

- University of Southampton, [B16/2015](https://data.southampton.ac.uk/building/16.html)
- The offices of [Thread](https://www.thread.com/) (1 Alie Street, London, E1 8DE)

If you don't have access to these rooms, throw a message in [Slack](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/messages/events) when you arrive, and someone will let you in. (If you're not in our Slack, please do [join us][https://goo.gl/forms/Maq41MHF8CYSRVn83]!)

The event, locations, and a link to the Google Meet call are available on the [Volunteer Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=studentrobotics.org_oqdjasvpps8smo0d5nte417rak%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon).

We are still looking for game design ideas. To submit a game proposal, please email competition-team@studentrobotics.org with a short description of your game. You can submit anything from an idea for an interesting game mechanic to a fully formed game idea. Diagrams may be helpful to clarify your idea, but aren't required.

We recommend taking a look at the already-submitted suggestions in [#game](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/messages/game). (If you're not in our Slack, please do [join us][https://goo.gl/forms/Maq41MHF8CYSRVn83]!)

We hope to see you there!
