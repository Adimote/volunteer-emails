Hello!

As many of you are aware, Kickstart is approching fast and this years kit needs to be sorted! To get all of this done a weekend of Kit Sorting is planned on the weekend of the **5-6th October** at the **University of Southampton**. 

We really do need all the help we can get! So if you are in the area and willing to attend, even for just a few hours, please reply to this email or message [Tom Wheal (`@tom.wheal`)](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/messages/kit-dev) on Slack! 

(Broken Biscuits and Banging Tunes will be provided)
We hope to see you there!
