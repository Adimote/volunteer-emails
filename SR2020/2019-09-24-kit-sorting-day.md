Hello!

As many of you are aware, Kickstart is approaching fast and this years kit needs to be sorted! To get all of this done a weekend of Kit Sorting is planned on the weekend of the **5-6th October** at the **University of Southampton**. The exact room will be confirmed at a later date!

The day will involve testing and fixing kit along with packing it up into boxes ready for kickstart, more information on this is available on the [Runbook](https://srobo.github.io/runbook/kit/hardware/kit-collation/).

We really do need all the help we can get! So if you are in the area and willing to attend, even for just a few hours, please reply to this email or message [Tom Wheal (`@tom.wheal`)](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/messages/kit-dev) on Slack! 

The event details and locations are available on the [Volunteer Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=studentrobotics.org_oqdjasvpps8smo0d5nte417rak%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon).

(Broken Biscuits and Banging Tunes will be provided)
We hope to see you there!
