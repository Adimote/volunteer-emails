Hello!

As many of you are aware, Kickstart is approaching fast and this years kit needs to be prepared for the students or they’ll have nothing to build their robots with! To get this done a weekend of Kit Sorting is planned on the **5-6th October** at the **University of Southampton** (You don’t need to be a university student to attend). The exact room will be confirmed at a later date.  

We will start organising everything from 9am with the main effort starting at 10am each day, so please show up by then. The weekend will involve testing and fixing kit along with packing it up into boxes ready for kickstart, however you don’t need any technical expertise to help. 

We really do need all the help we can get! So if you are in the area and willing to attend, even for just a few hours, please let us know **as soon as you can** by replying to this email or messaging [Tom Wheal (`@tom.wheal`)](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/messages/kit-dev) on Slack.

The event details and locations are available on the [Volunteer Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=studentrobotics.org_oqdjasvpps8smo0d5nte417rak%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon).

(Broken Biscuits and Banging Tunes will be provided)
We hope to see you there!
