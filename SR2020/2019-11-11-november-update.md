Hi all,

Here’s a roundup of all the things we’re currently working on to make SR2020
awesome. As ever, if you’d like to get involved please join us in our [Slack][slack]
([signup form][slack-signup]).

### Kickstart

As you’re probably aware, Kickstart happened at the end of October. A huge
thank-you to those who helped out, either at one of the venues or with any of
the preparation. It’s much appreciated and helped the events run smoothly.

### Supporting Teams

With the competition year now started, we’re organising Tech Days and team
Mentoring in order to support the teams as they build their robots.

#### Tech Days

Tech Days are fairly casual events we host for the teams to spend a day working
on their robots surrounded by volunteers and other teams. They are and are a
great opportunity to meet and work with other volunteers as well as see how the
teams are progressing. Tech Days are all day events (usually on a Saturday),
though if you can only make a part of the day that’s fine.

There’s no need to worry if you don’t know much about the kit or the robots --
Tech Days are a great place to learn about both by working alongside other
volunteers. Just asking the teams to explain what they’re working on and
providing a friendly outside perspective is really helpful.

The next Tech Day is in [London, on Saturday 30th November][london-tech-day] --
if you’d like to help out, please sign up to **[help at the London Tech Day][tech-day-signup]**.

Alternatively, if you think you would like to organise a Tech Day, please
[email the Competition Team](mailto:competition-team@studentrobotics.org).

#### Mentoring

Mentoring is an opportunity for you to get to know a team and to grow your
communication and team working skills, as well as help them improve their robot.

Your role as a mentor is to guide the team towards good solutions for their
robot, provide assistance where they might need it as well as help them
understand the kit, the rules and the competition as a whole. This doesn’t mean
that you need to know everything about these yourself (it’s completely fine not
to know things!), rather you will guide them towards finding the information for
themselves.

We have some [guidance for mentors][mentor-guidance] in our runbook which we
encourage all potential mentors to read and we will support you through the year.

The time commitment for mentoring varies by team, though it is typical to spend
a few hours every week or fortnight on a mentoring session. This includes travel
time, though we won’t ask you to travel further than you feel comfortable.

If you’d like to get a feel for whether there are any teams near you that you
might be able to visit, we have a [map of competing teams][teams-map].

### Competition Planning

Planning for the competition is now well under way. The competition team are
currently considering two potential venues:
 * University of Reading
 * University of Southampton

Over the next few weeks we’ll also be creating a list of the tasks which need
doing in order to make the competition happen. If you’d like to get involved
(even small contributions really help), please [join us][slack-signup] in our
[Slack][slack].
