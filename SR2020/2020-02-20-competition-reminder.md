Hello all,

Quick update on the volunteering opportunities:

## We still need volunteers for the competition!

The dates will be April 18th - 19th, with set-up days on the 17th and 16th if you’re available! The venue is RUSU, the University of Reading Student Union.

Accommodation will be free for volunteers, and we’ll provide lunch on the competition days. We may also reimburse travel depending on the budget, so keep your train ticket receipts!

Please sign up if you fancy coming: https://forms.gle/foHy82uY98wiPm587

**The deadline for applying to ensure you get accommodation is March 14th!!**

## Helping with Tech Days
Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their robot with lots of help available from us. They’re also an opportunity to see how other teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with your robots.

The next tech days coming up will be on:

| Date | Location | 
|February 29th |[London (Thread, Whitechapel)](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2020/london-tech-day-february/) |
| March 7th | [University of Southampton](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2020/southampton-tech-day-march/) |
| March 28th | [London (Thread, Whitechapel)](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2020/london-tech-day-march/) |

If you’re free to help out on a tech day, then just turn up! The events pages have all the details. Don’t worry if you’re new, we’d be happy to help you out with assisting teams or doing other things for the competition!

Thanks,
-- The Student Robotics Competition Team
