    - Last for between 2-4 minutes
    - Have point scoring that is accessible for teams of a wide range of abilities 
    - Have an arena layout that is easily and quickly set up at the beginning of each round

**Capabilities of the robots:**

    - Robots are no more than 500x500x500mm at the start of the match (although may expand after the match starts)
    - Camera gives positional feedback of any fidutial markers in view
