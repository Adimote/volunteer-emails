Hello,

Hope you have all been enjoying the summer and are now ready to start helping work towards Student Robotics 2020!

This year, we have decoupled the effort to organise the competition (Competition Team), and the effort to develop the next generation kit (Kit Team). As such, we have a new committee and are really looking forward to getting started.

Introducing the SR2020 Competition Team:

- Andy Barrett-Sprot
- Andy Busse
- Antoine Petty
- Hope Shaw
- Jake Howard
- James Seden Smith
- Jenny Fletcher
- Peter Law

There are a few different ways for you to get involved:

## The Game

We are currently looking for game design ideas for this year's competition. To submit a game proposal, please email competition-team@studentrobotics.org with a description up to about a page in length (feel free to add in diagrams if you'd like).

The submission deadline is the end of Sunday 1st September.

#### What we are looking for in a game

    - Played by 4 fully autonomous robots, but still playable by as few as 2
    - Be playable in an arena up to about 8m squared
    - Last for between 2-4 minutes
    - Have point scoring that is accessible for teams of a wide range of abilities 
    - Have an arena layout that is easily and quickly set up at the beginning of each round

#### Capabilities of the robots

    - Robots are no more than 500x500x500mm at the start of the match (although may expand after the match starts)
    - Camera gives positional feedback of any fidutial markers in view

After this date all submissions will be reviewed and discussed during a meeting open to all volunteers before the game design in finalised.

We look forward to looking through all your game design submissions!

### Task tickets

Soon, we will have a sizable bank of tasks which need to be completed, which you can [find on GitHub](https://github.com/srobo/tasks/issues). Each ticket there should have a small description of what needs to be done; and every task you can complete brings us one step closer to delivering another brilliant competition.

### Meetings

If you have some questions about a task you want to work on, or would just like to get a feel for what's going on, we will be opening our competition meetings for volunteers to join. The planned times will appear on [this calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=studentrobotics.org_oqdjasvpps8smo0d5nte417rak%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon) and you can join in Google Meet using the link in the calendar event.

You can also [join our Slack server](https://goo.gl/forms/Maq41MHF8CYSRVn83) if you haven't already. This lets you chat with other SR volunteers and get more frequent updates on our progress.

Here's to Student Robotics 2020!
