Hello everyone!

Today we announced the dates and locations for the SR2020 kickstart.

## What is kickstart?

Kickstart is the event which starts the competition year. We invite all teams to attend the event, where we unveil the game, issue their kits, and help competitors get acquainted with the kit.

## When / Where is kickstart?

This year we're planning to host three Kickstart events, all on Saturday 26th October:

- Cambridge (TBC)
- The offices of [Thread](https://www.thread.com/)
- The University of Southampton

More information for each venue can be found on [the website](https://studentrobotics.org/events). The event and locations are available on the [Volunteer Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=studentrobotics.org_oqdjasvpps8smo0d5nte417rak%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon).
