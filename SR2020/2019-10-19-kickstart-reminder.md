Hi all,

Kickstart is happening in exactly 1 week - and we could really do with your help to ensure it runs smoothly!

It'll run from 10am to 5pm (or whenever teams are finished).

If you'd like to help out and haven't signed up already, [fill out the Kickstart sign up form](https://forms.gle/1CPgReTxhCGn6rcx6) so we know who's coming!

We'll be hosting it simultaneously in 3 separate locations:

 - [Southampton](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2020/southampton-kickstart/)
 - [Central London](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2020/london-kickstart/)
 - [Cambridge](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2020/cambridge-kickstart/)

Also here are the details you need to know to help out:

Kickstart is scheduled to start at 10am, but setup starts at 9am if you're around to help out.

Also if you already have an SR t-shirt from a previous year (preferably from last year), please bring it to ensure you have one!

The exact details on how to to go for each kickstart is as follows:

### University of Southampton:
    Building 7
    University Rd
    Southampton

If you're arriving at 9am, Come to Building 53 and meet at the seminar room on the top floor. The building is ID-card access only, so you'll need to call us to be let in. If you arrive past 9:30ish or if there's nobody there, follow the directions on the website (go to Building 7).
